--- README OCR PROGRAM ---

* The aim of this program is to detect text on a given bmp image 
and convert it into a string.

* In order to do so, our program uses a multilayer perceptron network.

* How do I use the program ?

        -> type "./main name_of_the_image"

        -> WARNING: the picture's name MUST NOT contain the format extension
           for example, type "epiclim" and not "epiclim.bmp"

* If the program is not compiled, you can do it using the following command:
        -> "gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c99 -O1 -o main *.c
           `sdl2-config --cflags --libs`"
